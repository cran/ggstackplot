#' Have you ever wanted to create (partly) overlapping line plots with matched color-coding of the data and axes? These kinds of plots are common in climatology and oceanography research but there is not an easy way to create them with ggplot facets. The ggstackplot package builds on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to provide a straightforward approach to building these kinds of plots while retaining the powerful grammar of graphics approach of ggplots. Check out the functionality provided by ggstackplots at <https://ggstackplot.kopflab.org>
